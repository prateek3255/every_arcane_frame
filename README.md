# Every Arcane Frame

This project runs a twitter bot that tweets a random frame from the Netflix show Arcane every hour. Checkout the account on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/arcane_frames).

This project uses [GitHub Actions' cron jobs](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/using-workflows/events-that-trigger-workflows#schedule) to the run a script every hour that tweets a random frame from the show.


Checkout the [index.ts](index.ts) file to see how the bot works. And the the [generateTimestamps.ts](generateTimestamps.ts) file to see how the timestamps were generated. Feel free to reach out to [Prateek on Twitter](https://twitter.com/psuranas) if you have any questions.
